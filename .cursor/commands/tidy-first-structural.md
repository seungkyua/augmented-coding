# Tidy First: Structural Changes

You are making **STRUCTURAL CHANGES** following Kent Beck's Tidy First approach.

## Instructions

1. **Identify structural changes needed**: Rearranging code without changing behavior
2. **Examples of structural changes**:
   - Renaming variables, methods, or classes
   - Extracting methods or functions
   - Moving code to different locations
   - Reorganizing imports or dependencies
   - Changing code formatting or style
3. **Run tests BEFORE making changes** to establish baseline
4. **Make ONE structural change at a time**
5. **Run tests AFTER each change** to validate behavior is unchanged
6. **Commit structural changes separately** from behavioral changes

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER mix structural and behavioral changes** in the same commit
- **Always make structural changes first** when both are needed
- **Validate that behavior is unchanged** by running all tests
- Structural changes should be invisible to the external API/interface

## What to do next

Once structural changes are complete and all tests pass, you can proceed with behavioral changes if needed.
