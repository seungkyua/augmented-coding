# Next Test Implementation

You're ready to implement the next test in your TDD workflow. Follow Kent Beck's TDD principles.

## Instructions

1. **Look at plan.md** (if it exists) to find the next unmarked test
2. **Write ONE test at a time** - the simplest failing test
3. **Make it run** - implement minimum code to pass
4. **Improve structure** - refactor if needed, then commit
5. **Run all tests** (except long-running tests) each time

## Test Selection Guidelines

- Choose the smallest, simplest test case
- Focus on one behavior at a time
- Test should be meaningful and descriptive
- Start with the most basic functionality first
- Work incrementally toward more complex features

## Process

```
1. Find next unmarked test in plan.md (or decide on next test)
   ↓
2. Write failing test (RED)
   ↓
3. Implement minimum code to pass (GREEN)
   ↓
4. Run all tests - confirm they pass
   ↓
5. Make structural improvements if needed (Tidy First)
   ↓
6. Run tests again
   ↓
7. Commit (structural and behavioral changes separately)
   ↓
8. Mark test as complete and move to next test
```

## Remember

- Always write **one test at a time**
- Always make it **run** (pass)
- Always **improve structure** before moving on
- Always run **all tests** each time
