# Refactor Phase: Improve the Code

You are in the **REFACTOR** phase of the TDD cycle. Follow these steps:

## Instructions

1. **Ensure ALL tests are passing** before refactoring
2. **Make one refactoring change at a time**
3. **Run tests after each refactoring step**
4. **Use established refactoring patterns** with their proper names
5. **Prioritize refactorings** that remove duplication or improve clarity

## Refactoring Guidelines

- **Only refactor when tests are passing** (in the "Green" phase)
- Make structural changes without changing behavior
- Eliminate duplication ruthlessly
- Express intent clearly through naming and structure
- Make dependencies explicit
- Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility
- Minimize state and side effects

## Common Refactorings

- Extract Method
- Rename Variable/Method
- Extract Constant
- Remove Duplication
- Simplify Conditional
- Move Method/Class

## What to do next

After refactoring, run all tests to ensure nothing broke, then continue with the next TDD cycle if more functionality is needed.
