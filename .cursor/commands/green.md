# Green Phase: Make the Test Pass

You are in the **GREEN** phase of the TDD cycle. Follow these steps:

## Instructions

1. **Implement the minimum code** needed to make the test pass
2. **Write just enough code** - no more than necessary
3. **Run the test** to confirm it passes (Green)
4. **Use the simplest solution** that could possibly work
5. **Do NOT refactor yet** - wait until tests are passing

## Implementation Guidelines

- Write the simplest code that makes the test pass
- It's okay to hardcode values or use naive implementations
- Don't worry about code quality yet - that comes in the Refactor phase
- Focus on making the current test pass, nothing more
- Avoid adding functionality not covered by the test

## What to do next

Once the test passes, you can either:
- **Add another test** for more functionality, or
- **Move to REFACTOR phase** if the code needs improvement
