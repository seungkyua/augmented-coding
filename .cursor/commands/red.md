# Red Phase: Write a Failing Test

You are in the **RED** phase of the TDD cycle. Follow these steps:

## Instructions

1. **Write the simplest failing test** that defines a small increment of functionality
2. **Use meaningful test names** that describe behavior (e.g., "shouldSumTwoPositiveNumbers")
3. **Make test failures clear and informative**
4. **Write ONLY the test** - no implementation code yet
5. **Run the test** to confirm it fails for the right reason

## Test Writing Guidelines

- Start with the smallest possible test case
- Focus on one behavior at a time
- Name tests clearly: `test_should_<expectedBehavior>`
- Write test code that is easy to read and understand
- The test should fail because the feature doesn't exist yet, not because of a syntax error

## What to do next

After the test fails, move to the GREEN phase by implementing the minimum code needed to make the test pass.
